1. Difference between forEach and filter
   The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value.

Ex:     var sample = [1, 2, 3] // yeah same array
        var result = sample.filter(elem => elem !== 2)
        /* output */
        [1, 3]

2.  Map:
    Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run it against every element on the array but whats makes it unique is it generate a new array based on your existing array.
Ex:     let mapped = sample.map(elem => elem * 10)
        console.log(mapped);
        /* output */
        [10, 20, 30]
3. Reduce:
    Reduce method of the array object is used to reduce the array to one single value.

  Ex: var sum = sample.reduce((sum, elem) => sum + elem)
      console.log(sum);
      /* output */
      6
